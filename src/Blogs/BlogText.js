                <p>Exactly how much hope, energy, and willpower is there within each human life? At a time where thousands of our fellow humans are dying due to a magnitude of reasons— excuses, really, for incapable governments and inept leadership across the globe; the life stories of people like Abbas Karimi can deter our negative perceptions of the million reasons there are for each of us to fail and keep our souls focused on the one reason to succeed: Hope.</p>
                <p>He is an Olympian without arms. Not only that, he is an Afghan refugee. Through our perception, he does not possess the basic biological means to swim. We would generally assume that he wouldn’t even be able to simply pack his bags and go anywhere either. As if the physical and psychological pressures for going to the Olympics without arms, training facilities, “a country”, etc. aren’t enough, imagine having to run from one country to the next to save your life, to finally find a “debatable peace” of mind, time, and facility to train for the Olympics as a refugee. Step #1, just the thought of traveling to 3,000+ miles journey to Turkey and then two refugee camps, wouldn’t be as simple as picking up your backpack and move. How would you grab your backpack, without arms, anyway? But Abbas did all that and more…</p>
                <p>Human beings are strange creatures.</p>
                <h4>“We are capable of flying without wings, running without legs, and swimming without arms. Such is a vivid example of our key differentiator with other biological beings on our planet. We are governed by our emotional intelligence and driven by our willpower.”</h4>
                <p>If we want to make something happen, we will make it happen without always having the seemingly vital tangible necessities. Thus, our achievements cannot be measured by the laws of physics or computed through obvious math that is ignorant of our inner capabilities.</p>
                <p>At a time when all the lost lives, investments, and humanitarian aids to Afghanistan seem shattered, achievements of super-naturals like Abbas can give us hope. Hope for a better future for all…!</p>

                <p>It has been a long time I haven’t had the chance to write a blog, now writing this in a time that the global pandemic, COVID-19, is testing humanity’s patience, as well as our applications and data center capabilities globally and more radically than we are used to…</p>
                <h4>“Numerous applications out there may have never been tested to such degree of an unexpected surge in application peak time and prolonged use.”</h4>
                <p>Numerous applications out there may have never been tested to such degree of an unexpected surge in application peak time and prolonged use. In parallel to this surge, a steep rise in cybersecurity threats and application vulnerabilities can naturally be expected. Are we prepared for what has already arrived at our door-steps? What are we doing to prepare for the post-corona-era?</p>
                <h4>“Global data centers are being tested to their limits of efficiency and capacity while maintaining their availability and resilience.”</h4>
                <p>Applications run via the data centers that support their purpose. Global data centers are being tested to their limits of efficiency and capacity while maintaining their availability and resilience. This is true whether we operate data centers for industries that are experiencing unusually slow demand, such as hospitality and tourism, or we are operating data centers for industries that are maximizing their utilization of resources to respond to the ever-increasing demand.</p>
                <h4>“Extremely underutilized facilities will be burning resources more than ever before and in certain cases might even cause service interruptions.”</h4>
                <p>If we operate data centers for the organizations that are experiencing a severe decline in application use, our data centers can become extremely underutilized. However, data center facilities such as chillers and generators deliver optimum efficiency at their recommended optimum utilization. Therefore, if not designed properly, when the revenue streams are limited and cost-savings are most needed, underutilized facilities will be burning resources more than ever before. In certain cases, they might even cause service interruptions. Thus, the efficiency of our data centers, in certain industries, is being stress-tested as we speak. At the same time, if we operate data centers for the surging applications such as social media platforms, video-on-demand, and healthcare, the utilization of our data centers is either reaching its max or exceeding it. In such cases, our data centers are being stress-tested at active loads that are probably beyond the original design specifications for the duration of an average peak expectancy. Therefore, whether our data centers are experiencing the stress of underutilization or overutilization, they are being stress-tested in a way or another.</p>
                <h4>“Are we then ready to run our data center facilities completely remote, or in absolute isolation? Can our data centers run unmanned for prolonged periods?”</h4>
                <p>In the midst of this harsh and sudden ongoing test, human resource management becomes another convoluted challenge. During a widespread disease such as the coronavirus, the notions of quarantine and self-isolation are being advocated more and more. What if we reach a state whereby the essential on-site data center operation staff are no longer suggested to work remote, rather instructed by the authorities to stay put and avoid any further commute? Are we then ready to run our data center facilities completely remote, or in absolute isolation? Can our data centers run unmanned for prolonged periods? Regardless of the answer, we should step back and contemplate a little. It is important that we are constructive with our every move and emerge successfully in the face of every challenge or crisis. So let’s convert this COVID-19 challenge into an opportunity to transpire from the pandemic with more robust capabilities and with higher awareness of our true efficacies. We can accomplish that by reviewing and assessing our true capabilities and delivery claims, document our lessons learned, and take the necessary precautions, while we still can…</p>

                <p>The publication of this blog coincides with the Independence Day. Though this junction was not intended with strong emphasis, nevertheless the following should provide an aspirational insight for us to always maintain a certain level of independence on the global stage for both our businesses and our government…</p>
                <p>While larger organizations move into hyper-scale environments, these days, most businesses do not build their own data centers anymore. This trend represents the notion that the biggest providers such as Amazon, Microsoft, IBM and Google are becoming the default options of choice. Question is, are we unknowingly, by embracing these seemingly default choices, limiting our own options? Is the embodiment of this trend, a noble inclination?</p>
                <p>Generally speaking about trends, our philosophy is that no trend is a good trend, when the trend itself becomes the goal, instead of serving as a calculated mean to achieve the actual target. That’s when we start losing sight of our core intentions and the underlying reasons for the emergence of what we now consider our goal. It is a fact that with every trend, there comes a baggage of business/marketing agenda that tends to dilute the true essence and purpose of the trend itself. Trends come to life out of existing gaps and the thirst to innovate. However, the trends themselves become bottlenecks to novelty when they become our idles. This takes all the innovation away and delays the technological evolution.</p>
                <h4>No trend is a good trend, when the trend itself becomes the goal.</h4>
                <p>The subject occurrence has happened numerously in the world of information technology. For example, an old concept introduced decades ago, which we lost sight of for many years, got reintroduced to us again via a different label: virtualization. All of a sudden, after decades of delay, it is everyone’s hot-topic again and we somehow think it’s some brilliantly devised new invention, rather than a delayed evolution of the original novel.</p>
                <h5>Question 1. Should we outsource our Cloud? It depends.</h5>
                <p>Cloud is a good thing, no doubt. We are the biggest proponents of it. But the question is, what kind of Cloud is the right solution for us, our companies, or our governments, etc.? Moreover, hypothetically speaking, how much of this “Cloud” can we outsource?</p>
                <h4>It is the nature of science to learn by observation and experience: trial and error.</h4>
                <p>To shed light into the perspective of where these key questions take us, let’s render a non-IT/non-Cloud example:</p>
                <p>We lost the skillsets, the agility, as well as the will to produce and manufacture many products and components when we outsourced most of our production to certain other (“more cost-effective”) countries. Our dependence on such countries will remain costly till eternity. Furthermore, our national resilience will remain at the custody of those nations until and unless we reverse and pay for the reversal of our past decisions. Thus, until further notice, our decisions and the associated costs of such decisions, will be directly impacted by the strategic dependence we chose to have on the outside world.</p>
                <img src="/middlepic.jpg" width={'100%'} />
                <p>Now in the manufacturing world, after paying hefty recovery costs, building skillful labor, reinstating factories, etc. it a feasible and commendable possibility to bring manufacturing back home. However, in the ever-transforming world of information technology, reversing such decisions prove extremely costly and render slim feasibilities. When we outsource our infrastructure to any 3rd party, specially the big players, we are saying farewell to our own infrastructure resourcefulness and independence for the life of our enterprise. This is a fact. We are also betting that “they” will do a better job than we do with our data management.</p>
                <h4>When we outsource our infrastructure to any 3rd party, specially the big players, we are saying farewell to our own infrastructure resourcefulness and independence for the life of our enterprise.</h4>
                <p>Yes, nobody can be totally independent. Correct, it’s all about efficiency and focusing on one’s business rather than getting into complex operations that can possibly be done better by outsourced providers. But, once you migrate your application over to a given cloud provider, migrating to another provider or bringing some of the infrastructure back home to the enterprise is not as simple as a manufacturing plant who can, easily shop around and switch between suppliers of its raw materials. Technology always does have its complexities when it comes to providers, especially cloud providers. Therefore it’s undoubtedly different from outsourcing raw materials for traditional production.</p>
                <h5>Question 2. What is Cloud anyway? Something you need to understand.</h5>
                <p>So, with everyone talking about it these days, what is Cloud anyway? Many people don’t even have a non-contradictory comprehension of its merits, pros and cons. Meanwhile, going Cloud is the goal for many institutions, not using Cloud as a mean to achieve certain business results. It gets even worse, when the goal is not only going to the Cloud, rather migrating to a specific provider’s cloud. One could ask, why not your own private cloud? Why not a hybrid solution? Why so much emphasis on a specific provider? If you have your reasons, don’t let us stop you because you are probably on track. But if you are migrating to somebody’s Cloud because you see everyone else is doing so, or you read a couple of articles on how great a given cloud is for others, think again. The same might not be true for you. Go back and do “your study”. What makes migrating to a 3rd party’s cloud a feasible choice for you, is the business optimization processes that makes it so within your organization. The solution to your Cloud questions can be found inside your organization and from within, not the vendor’s brochure. It is your business needs that can make a particular Cloud decision good or bad, success or failure, short-term or long-term.</p>
                <h4>The solution to your Cloud questions can be found inside your organization and from within, not the vendor’s brochure.</h4>
                <h5>Question 3. Can Google, Amazon and Microsoft fail? Yes, they can.</h5>
                <p>Can Google fail? Can Amazon fail? Can Microsoft fail? Maybe the question can be answered by asking another: Is failure directly correlated with the size and might of an enterprise? Can anyone become too big to fail? Or, is it just a matter of time? Will these big companies make mistakes? Of course they will. Making mistakes and failing is what matures their offerings and optimizes their performance. Are live threats standing by to capitalize on those mistakes and exploit those vulnerabilities as vantage points? You bet there are. It is the nature of science to learn by observation and experience: trial and error. Note that there is only so much your provider can predict and devise ahead of time to fully preserve and protect your data and application. This spirit becomes more intrinsically embedded in everything we do as the nature of much of Cloud work is pushed by a massive profit agenda of keeping up with the consumer demand and company’s plans for expansion of apps, features, and offerings. In these seemingly good times, margin of error just goes up to the roof as the core of the scientific work and progress is not centered around maintaining health anymore, rather expanding prospects!</p>
                <h4>It is the nature of science to learn by observation and experience: trial and error.</h4>
                <p>Companies must have a holistic understanding of their own Application Ecosystem™ and identify the fine line between where and what it is that they want to outsource. Governments should really think twice before using public cloud services as a matter of preserving and ensuring national security. By the same token, they must ensure that they operate on a calculated series of resilient, secure, and robust clouds of their own to be able to warrant and preserve national security and prevent large-scale catastrophes.</p>
                <h5>Question 4. What is the impact of their failure? Too much.</h5>
                <p>Do we possess studies that measure, even with distant proximity, the true social, economical and political impacts of a big digital failure? More specifically, what is the impact to our economy if the big providers failed today? Are they too big to fail or, too soon to bail? Can the government even bail them out if they do fail, just like it bailed the banks or the auto industry? Bailing a bank financially is one thing, recovering lost data and rectifying compromised information is another. If the entire world migrated to Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and the like, then the target of a potential disruption would be only a handful of companies instead of millions of businesses. Can the concept of loss even be comprehended for such scenarios? Can the measure of such loss be numerically displayed?</p>
                <h4>Millions of businesses, hundreds of millions of people paralyzed with failures of just a couple of companies is a notion that has not been put to test before in the history of mankind.</h4>
                <p>Millions of businesses, hundreds of millions of people paralyzed with failures of just a couple of companies is a notion that has not been put to test before in the history of mankind. Yet, we travel the path as if those companies are just too big to fail. Are these companies made up of people smarter than the people they host? Can their riches protect them one hundred percent from the ever-growing threats? Are these enterprises free from inevitable decline, which is the consistent and fierce faith of any empire throughout history? Will these providers then become the pinnacle of a single-point-of-failure architecture across our Application Ecosystem™ stack?</p>
                <h5>Question 5. So what do we do? Do the right thing.</h5>
                <p>Study your own business. Know your own applications. Calculate each and every decision across your Application Ecosystem™ knowing that what might be the perfect solution for one company might render the total opposite for you.</p>
                <p>Are we suggesting that migrating to AWS, Azure, etc. is a mistake and everyone should design, build and operate all their infrastructure in-house? No, we are not. Our suggestion is simple: while Amazon, Google, Microsoft maintain/grow their dominance and serve as effective remedies for on-demand and dynamically scaled application delivery, companies and governments should not consider them the exclusive and eternal choice for their application delivery.</p>
                <h4>While Amazon, Google, Microsoft maintain/grow their dominance and serve as effective remedies for on-demand and dynamically scaled application delivery, companies and governments should not consider them the exclusive and eternal choice for their application delivery.</h4>
                <p>If your economy does not warrant you the resilience, capacity and the reach to build your own topology, go for 3rd party cloud providers. If you do go for cloud providers, your business should then become focused on implementing resilience across multiple providers as apposed to your own data center nodes. Make sure that whatever you do, do not give one hundred percent of your cloud operation away. Keep a little bit of knowhow, infrastructure, governance and “edge” to yourself.</p>

                <p>Business owners and Technology stakeholders have never had a systematic and dynamic mechanism that provided a holistic end-result driven evaluation of the effectiveness of the vast and disparate array of information, applications, resources, technologies, processes, personnel, infrastructure, documentation, standards and governance that together, despite their inherit complexity, form the ecosystem that powers their business. Nor have they had a common language that allowed them to effectively interact with their executive leadership and peers as well as industry stakeholders, vendors, and service providers in a way that universally assures projected business results, until now. The Infinity Paradigm® empowers organizations to truly synchronize technology strategies, designs, plans, implementations and operations with business strategy; and to optimize business strategy with accurate data indicating true capabilities, vulnerabilities, and competencies obtained from every layer of the Application Ecosystem™.</p>
                <p>Until recently, a data center was most commonly understood to be a single facility located at a specific site. IDCA’s Infinity Paradigm® considers this definition to be completely inadequate, and thus has redefined it to measure up to its modern task. The function of the data center is to serve the application, and today’s business application requirements usually demand that it be delivered across multiple sites and facilities. Whereas predecessors tend to focus on a narrow or micro view of a single element, the Infinity Paradigm® provides stakeholders with big picture (macro) as well as detailed (micro) views of their entire Application Ecosystem™ stack.</p>

                <p>The rapid evolution in the areas of information technology, cloud, data center facilities, IoT, big data, cyber security, business sustainability and national security has revealed and highlighted unresolved infrastructure issues, and shortcomings in the practices and the ideological principles of the past.</p>
                <p>To this end, key questions have remained unanswered: How do we address the ever-growing challenges with data center cooling, ensure power efficacy, and be redundant in components and paths while eliminating redundant costs? How can we obtain the necessary resilience, remain efficient, and achieve security and safety at the same time? How do we align a staff of platform, network, storage, security, electrical and mechanical engineering professionals to serve a single common goal? How do we deploy application delivery models that actually meet our unique business and application needs, as opposed to dealing with “one size fits all” solutions?</p>
                <h5>The Problem: Legacy Principles, Modern Requirements</h5>
                <p>How do we address the dichotomies we are all faced with – operations vs. infrastructure, distribution vs. consolidation, CapEx vs. OpEx, energy efficient vs. resilience, security vs. complexity, and more – all while staying in budget? How do we address the non-technical trends that may impact our organization, such as legislation and governance, geopolitics, climate or sustainability trends, and other diverse and conflicting priorities?</p>
                <p>There is a vivid need for a universal language and understanding amongst all stakeholders in the data center industry. This need can present itself in the fine details, such as a lack of an industry wide color coding scheme for cabling and piping, resulting in the increased probability of human error related outages as workers go from one company to another. It can also present itself on the broader strategic level, where service providers and their customers have no common basis for quantifying and qualifying performance requirements and capabilities.</p>
                <h5>The Solution: The Infinity Paradigm®</h5>
                <p>Established by the International Data Center Authority, Infinity Paradigm® is the fundamental framework for organizations to reduce business risk, and optimize & align performance with defined business requirements. It is the framework for visualizing and analyzing an entire information technology system as a holistic and dynamic model, in a manner that qualitatively and quantitatively illustrates the myriad of interdependencies of its various supporting components. This model is called the Application Ecosystem™, and it is comprised of various physical layers of technical infrastructure as well as some conceptual or logical layers that are derived from those physical layers.</p>
                <p>These layers are commonly depicted in a pyramid fashion to illustrate the concept of the interdependent infrastructure stack. The layers include the Topology (T) Layer at the foundation of the pyramid, followed by the Site layer, the Site Facilities Infrastructure (SFI) layer, the Information Technology Infrastructure (ITI) layer, the Compute (C) layer, the Platform (P) layer, and finally the Application (A) layer.</p>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Each layer, except for the Topology layer, can be comprised of multiple discreet instances of infrastructure working in concert to support the layers above them. These instances may have a one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationship with the instances of infrastructure in the layers below it.</p>
                <h5>Infinity Paradigm® Benefits</h5>
                <p>As we have seen in the preceding scenarios, the Infinity Paradigm® can present a wide variety of benefits, based on the challenges each end user is attempting to discover or solve. From a C level executive down to an entry-level staff engineer, from a public sector organization to a global corporation to a local small business, every adopter and constituent is empowered by its comprehensive capabilities and relentlessly thorough approach. Among the many benefits presented by the Infinity Paradigm®, certain key features stand out:</p>
                <h5>Comprehensive & Cloud-inclusive</h5>
                <p>The Infinity Paradigm® was founded on the basis of bridging existing industry gaps. It enforces a comprehensive view of the logical and physical aspects of information technology, data centers, and Cloud, as well as their investments, designs, infrastructure, personnel, performance metrics, overall operations, and management. Virtualization is essential to the modern era computing environments. The Infinity Paradigm® is the pioneer of introducing cloud and virtualized services as a key factor of the next-generation standards framework.</p>
                <h5>Operations Conducive</h5>
                <p>Operational conduciveness is a foundational element of the Infinity Paradigm®. The industry has favored availability and resilience over operational effectiveness for far too long. IDCA’s philosophy dictates that an infrastructure’s availability, capacity, security, safety, compliance, etc. cannot be measured unless its operational requirements are fully evaluated and met. Only a demonstrable operational competency with each component’s individual function and the interdependencies between components will fulfill Infinity Paradigm’s requirements of compliance.</p>
                <h5>Efficiency and Innovation Driven</h5>
                <p>IDCA’s standards framework promotes efficiency and innovation as vital efficacies. Their continuous involvement and active roles within the organization are the driving force that constantly evolves an organization’s Application Ecosystem™ through phases of development, implementation, and operation; bringing cost-efficiency, viability, feasibility, enhanced productivity, competitive-edge and enriched efficacies. The notion of “Infinity” is meant to symbolize the infinite possibilities that result from the continuous pursuit of perfection.</p>
                <h5>International, Yet Localized</h5>
                <p>The Infinity Paradigm® was designed to bring the world’s best and brightest together, allowing all cloud, application, information technology, facility and data center stakeholders to enjoy the synergy that globalized collaboration can provide. It is extensible and adaptable to localized technical, language, environmental, regulatory, political, and industrial requirements and capabilities. This unprecedented level of “reality-centric” customization, allows for ease of access, enhanced efficiency, safety, compliance and effectiveness.</p>
                <h5>Effective & Application-Centric</h5>
                <p>One of the Infinity Paradigm’s core missions is ensuring effectiveness via the notion of practicality. Its framework matrix enables a practical, intuitive, detailed and holistic understanding of the entire ecosystem. As the first organization to acknowledge and promote the purpose of data centers to be application delivery, IDCA has effectively redefined the data center as ”the infrastructure supporting the Application Ecosystem™”. This new, application-centric approach eliminates redundant and goalless efforts, honing in on a data center’s true purpose, enabling stakeholders to set accurate expectations and properly strategize towards satisfying their application needs.</p>
                <h5>Vendor Neutrality</h5>
                <p>IDCA does not solicit or accept input from technology manufacturers, and therefore the standards framework is not biased toward or against any particular manufacturers, technologies, or technical solutions.</p>
                <h5>Enabling Service Provider Integration Strategies</h5>
                <p>The Infinity Paradigm® enables and empowers the integration of cloud and infrastructure service providers into the end user’s Application Ecosystem by providing a common grading model for service providers to validate performance capabilities far beyond basic service levels agreements. Service provider’s Efficacy Ratings and G Scores can be integrated into the end user’s ESR score directly, providing management with the most powerful tool yet to understand the impact that partner integration has on their overall operations.</p>
                <h5>Open Community Effort</h5>
                <p>The Infinity Paradigm® is a free, open data center framework available worldwide. It empowers functional performance on a global scale, while adapting to local requirements. It provides the stakeholder with an all-inclusive standards framework granting total control over Availability, Efficiency, Security, Capacity, Operation, Innovation and Resilience based on the specific needs of the business.</p>
                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                <p>The Infinity Paradigm® bridges existing industry gaps by providing a comprehensive open standards framework capable of handling the complexity of the post-legacy information technology and data center age. It maintains a focus on certain unique core values: comprehensiveness, effectiveness, practicality, and adaptability. This framework, and the standards, controls, and guidance that support it, will grow and evolve over time through the input and collaboration of its users around the world, continuously redefining the very essence of what information technology, cloud, and the data center is and does. It integrates legacy standards and guidelines, remaining fully aware of their strengths and limitations, in a forward looking and practical way. As a result, the Infinity Paradigm® provides information technology, cloud, and data center designers, planners, builders, operators and end-users with a holistic and constructive approach, addressing the problems of today and challenges of tomorrow.</p>

                <p>Data center design, build, operation and ownership are entering a new era. It will not be long before those operators who failed to adapt, will perish by the virtue of their own making. Whether there will be more or less data centers, greater or fewer outsourcing, expansion of public or private clouds, larger or smaller data centers, are each subjects of another discussion and another blog. But to build a data center roadmap that is necessary to deal with the recent challenges and still remain a prospering business by 2020, all data center owners must align themselves to the below in 2017.</p>
                <h5>1. Become application centric – STOP leaking…</h5>
                <p>If you have been a fan of Cisco, HP, APC, Emerson, etc., those days are over. All brands and goods out there should become commodities that you would easily be willing to alternate and exchange, if doing so makes business/financial sense to you. Data centers must stop building around a preferred technology. Rather, understanding the application and building everything around it is key. This should be your #1 priority for 2017. You must find relevance between all the seven stack layers of your Application Ecosystem (AE) and design to suit, build to suit, outsource to suit, operate to suit to one thing: “the application”.</p>

                <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
                    <div>
                        <img src="/pyramid-ae-new.png" width={'350px'} />
                        <h4 style={{ padding: '0px', border: '0', fontSize: '18px', textAlign: 'center', margin: '0px', fontWeight: '300', color: '#696969' }}>Application Ecosystem (AE) 7-Layer Stack</h4>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>How effective, safe, secure, resilient, robust, and efficient you build and operate your application ecosystem is vital for you to successfully face and address the new breed of data center and information technology challenges. It is only when you think application is king that you would realize how much you are bleeding and leaking either across or between different layers of your application ecosystem. For some organizations the misalignment between different layers and subsequent leakage of resources could mean billions, while for many it would be in millions. But whatever the amount would be, it will be too much to sustain if you don’t rollout this initiative in 2017.</p>
                <p>2. Educate your people – GET serious…</p>
                <p>If you have been limping on one leg so far with regards to your human resources, get serious. You can’t possibly remain competitive or financially feasible over the coming years, should you continue this path. Your people are the sole reason you either win or loose in the data center arena. Whether you run your own data centers or you outsource them completely, the individuals dealing with your “data” must be trained, period. Their value judgment can give you the right information as decisive inputs, manage and operate your infrastructure effectively, avoid mistakes and prevent human errors, choose the right products/services for your application ecosystem, understand and communicate effectively with their peers in the same layer or layers above and below their own AE layer, and ultimately prevent massive wastes, which are probably ongoing as we speak. Optimizing the output of your data centers goes back to how well-informed your people are about their role and its cause and effects on your application ecosystem. You must give them that education and mandate them to learn. If your people think data center is simply the housing of IT systems, warehouse of chillers, generators, structured cabling, core routers and switches, you can already see the tip of the iceberg of problems coming your way. Do NOT be too confident with your staff’s capability to run specific components. How to run a generator or configuring a router, should be the prerequisite for one’s job enrollment to begin with. How to run all of that within the context of data center is another discipline all by itself. It is the interoperability of all these components and more that you need to educate your human resources on. Earning such discipline would not a natural occurrence, at least not on your watch. Data center discipline must be learned, hopefully not be trial and “error”. If your staff don’t step up and understand the holistic nature of things, sky is the limit for how many facets you would be loosing from, practically on daily basis. You cannot afford to walk into the upcoming generation of data centers without the appropriately educated personnel.</p>
                <h5>3. Become industry specific – BE yourself…</h5>
                <p>If you are a healthcare institution, your data center must look different from an airport’s data center. If you are a university, you should have a unique set of differences with the way in which you design, build and operate your data center as compared to a defense or military organization. This analogy is applicable to all industries. If you are not adhering to your specific organization not only from a compliance standpoint, but also from the need and approach perspective, you are missing the point. You must identify the uniqueness of your specific industry, which could range from the people you would hire, the outsourcing modes you would consider, the geographical regions you could have presence, the type of telecom you can utilize, the average density for your cabinets, the safety and security precautions you must recognize and much more. Thus, your data center should have a very definitive look to it that is specifically unique to and aligned with the nature of your industry.</p>
                <h5>4. Become Cloud driven – ZOOM out…</h5>
                <p>Instead of building a 2N+1 facility then thinking how it would serve within the whole scheme of things, it is only wise to devise the resilience and capacities you require within your cloud. You could have a number of N-based DCNs that together deliver you a much more robust infrastructure that are easier to commission, decommission, manage, etc. than having one gigantic and fault-tolerant site that hosts all your eggs in one basket. After all, that “one site” is a single-point-of-failure. You could have two 2N sites, or one 2N + one N+1 site that give you all you need and for your specific requirements. You might find that cheaper to run and maintain than having eight locations to deal with. The pros, cons and feasibilities of all of this will manifest into the cloud mindset, not the narrow site-minded view. You can only warrant true availability, security and efficiency when you zoom out of a specific site and see your infrastructure from a broader spectrum. In short, you should care less how many generators are running in a given site if your overall cloud architecture is satisfied for a particular site to just have one. If you stepped into 2017 without a grander cloud initiative, 2018 will be a tough one.</p>
                <h5>5. Build effective manuals – DOCUMENT everything…</h5>
                <p>You buy a bicycle, a smart phone, or anything for that matter, it usually comes with a manual. Devices run better, and lot of mistakes could be avoided, when their operators read manuals first. This was a lesson learnt at the break of the 20th century and implemented throughout World Wars I and II. How can we run mega facilities that cater to lives in the 21st century, without proper manuals and effective documentation? Without documentation every new rollout, every installation, every new hire, every vendor, task or management call is a challenge. What you need to do is to make sure every task becomes a routine and falls within a refined framework with proceeding guidelines that have already been thought of and planned for ahead. If you are running 10 sites today, you need minimum 11 manuals. You would need, at the very least, 10 manuals for each specific data center node to address the needs and concerns of the resident as well as the remote staff that deal with a specific DCN, making them aware of exit routes, UPS maintenance regime, and anything that is node-specific. Then, you need a universal data center cloud (DCC) or topology manual that tells your cloud operators how the whole setup is interlinked, managed and run and how is application being deployed and delivered across these multiple DCNs. Matters of latency, weather forecasts, global installations and operations, training requirements, SLAs, OLAs, application and compute management from the aggregation of all data center nodes must be addressed in the DCC manual. Remember it’s all about efficiency. Therefore, make sure your manual is neither too thick nor too slim. In either extreme, it will loose its effectiveness. It must be sized, worded and toned just right to aid deliver the KPIs it aims to preserve.</p>
                <h4>At the brink of 2020s drastic changes can be predicted. One can only be prepared for future if the challenges of the past have already been resolved.</h4>
                <p>At the brink of 2020s drastic changes can be predicted. One can only be prepared for future if the challenges of the past have already been resolved. The above five action items are the most basic and fundamental adoptions data center stakeholders must make. For those who have a vision of what’s ahead, 2017 should serve as platform for a set of phased initiatives. Such initiatives must cultivate and render a 3-year (2017-2019) agenda for change.

                <p>Life is impossible without compromises. Data centers, like any other walk of life, are resolutions of a chain of compromises. Usually people believe that the main compromise in data centers is between cost and availability. It’s not that simple, unfortunately. To compromise, organizations typically undermine important measures in order to render maximized outputs for a given KPI. So what are some important data center compromises? What are these compromises costing us? What are the opportunity costs for each or in simpler terms, what are we giving up to achieve a certain other? These are all questions that need to be answered for a well-balanced and equilibrium data center.</p>
                <h5>Availability vs. Efficiency</h5>
                <p>These days it has become a ritual for data centers to compromise high-efficiency for high-availability and vice versa. Usually, if you found an “availability-centric” data center, you would find it hard to simultaneously sense tangible efficiency measures implemented. With the same token, when you visit “efficiency-centric” data centers, availability can be at grave risks. We’ll take free cooling as an example. Free cooling is a viable solution if it’s engineered right and your data center node is located in the right environment. Depending on free cooling alone to facilitate a mission-critical data center node can be catastrophic to your availability requirements. This is due to the fact that you can’t simply open the windows and enjoy the fresh air. By opening the windows, you are allowing unwanted expenses and threats such as dust, moisture, EMI, heat, cold, etc. to creep into your data center. So what you ought to do is to bring the outside air into specialized chambers, then, sample and measure the air against your acceptance thresholds. Accordingly, you must subsequently treat the air to your ideals. This means that if the air is too hot, you need to pay to cool it; if it’s too cold, you need to pay to heat it (this is why you can’t just build your data center in the north pole). If it’s too dry, you must humidify it, and if it’s too moist, you must dehumidify. If you are sitting on volcanic belts or in dust prone environments, the cost of filtering and shielding yourself against all the potential threats can be greater than what you originally planned to save via this approach. Ignoring these important and necessary facts and simply trying to be “efficient” will hamper your availability and even prove that your efficient cooling methodology is not so efficient after all. On the contrary, installing and operating excessively redundant units of power, cooling, and other equipment in a single location whereby your application is supposed to be supported by a series of locations may not be the most efficient choice. This is another critical reason that your data center must be application-centric and you must always see yourself and every choice you make as an integral part of the application ecosystem.</p>
                <h4>When application delivery is your true aim, then exerting too much in too little and vice versa doesn’t make sense anymore.</h4>
                <h5>Safety vs. Security</h5>
                <p>Sometimes over emphasis on the security aspect of your data center can adversely affect site and personnel safety. Likewise, certain safety emphasis can put security at risk. For example, there are technologies that can provide further security to a data center node by emitting radiations. But these can be harmful to your people and your equipment. So utilizing them is out of the question. Likewise, implementing some safety measures i.e. uncoordinated and unjustified safety drills without regard to security protocols can put the data center at serious security risks. Other examples could be when your people need to make an emergency call for an ambulance from inside a faraday cage that is aimed to prevent EMI, EPO button that may disable the elevator half-way when people are still inside, authentication system that fails from the inside when people are trying to exit during emergencies, or electrified fencing to secure the data center perimeter, which can put people’s life in danger. Thus, it is crucial that your safety and security teams work hand-in-hand to provide a well-balanced environment that is simultaneously safe and secure for your data center and its resources.</p>

                </div>
                <h5>Resilience vs. Capacity</h5>
                <p>Assume that you have a facility that runs on a pair of 1MW generators, designed for a 2N parallel configuration. As you add IT load your eventual actual live load ends up to be ~ 1.5MW. In this case, do you still have the 2N resilience that you had planned for? Surely not! You simply compromised your resilience to satisfy your capacity needs. This is why a data center’s infrastructure cannot be measured in isolation from its operational parameters. Understanding this fine element, underlines the importance of capacity as an integral part to your ecosystem. Having redundancy without taking the actual capacity needs into consideration is meaningless.</p>
                <h4>Having redundancy without taking the actual capacity needs into consideration is meaningless.</h4>
                <p>Therefore, a data center is required to balance its resilience requirements with its capacity needs. This is analogous to the story of roads and transport in our mega cities. Having roads is one thing, but being able to use them when you need them the most, without sitting in traffic for two hours, is something else. Many metropolitan residents experience this all the time. The road is there, wide-open when you don’t need to use it situated at work or sleeping at home, but as soon as you want to get to work or drive home, traffic simply wont move. So it is not enough to just have roads, what’s needed is a road system with ample capacity that can handle the traffic/load during peak. The story of our obsolete roads and transport system can be the subject of another discussion. What’s important here is that data centers cannot be measured by the number of UPSs, chillers, CRAHs or generators they posses. Rather, how these overall systems service the required load and still remain resilient is key.</p>
                <h5>Physical Security vs. IT Security</h5>
                <p>Sometimes you wonder what goes into the minds of policy-makers when they make the data center entrances and visits so difficult and cumbersome at some facilities, while many of the same data centers severely lack proper IT security for their hosted applications. If we spend as much money, time and effort that we spend in fences, cages, barriers, cameras, mantraps, security counters and security personnel into IT security of our data center, then, and only then, our security investment will result in true outputs, not show business! At the same time, all the IT security can prove useless if physical security is compromised. Again, the problem is the lack of application ecosystem-mindset and improper understanding of what a data center truly is and ought to deliver. If the goal of security is to secure the application ecosystem, then all the attention will not be vested over fencing just the generators or just in firewalls. This calls for a balanced approach towards security that will have the security teams and policy-makers understand the consequences and to work simultaneously on both the physical as well as IT aspects of the application ecosystem security.</p>
                <h5>Infrastructure vs. Operations</h5>
                <p>The best infrastructure will not save you from data center shortfalls when you have not invested as much in your people. Likewise, the best people will not protect you when you have not vested as much attention into your infrastructure. You cannot give a non-redundant, non-efficient, unsafe, unstable and insecure infrastructure gear to your people and expect them to deliver high marks of service, including 99.999% availability, no compromise on security, absolute safety, OpEx reductions, etc. simply because you hired the best and the brightest. In such cases, even Superman can’t help you. At the same time, you cannot hire unqualified personnel and expect them to run your state-of-the-art data center flawlessly. Both notions are disaster scenarios. Your people’s knowhow, expertise quality and quantity combined with your predefined effective operational policies and procedures, must be aligned with the quantity and quality of your infrastructure for your organization to maximize its potentials and optimize its use of its vested resources.</p>
                <h4>Your people’s knowhow, expertise quality and quantity combined with your predefined effective operational policies and procedures, must be aligned with the quantity and quality of your infrastructure for your organization to maximize its potentials and optimize its use of its vested resources.</h4>
                <h5>IT vs. Facility</h5>
                <p>Usually organizations are either IT bias or facility bias, whereas balancing both is the recipe for success. You can pretty much get a sense of the data center architect’s background as soon as you walk into a site, by witnessing how focused or distracted the data center is on certain aspects. If you just spent $50million on your new IT assets, have you made sure that your site and facility are geared to render you the level of service your new IT gear deserves? If not, you just wasted your money. Similarly, if you just built a brand new data center facility for an IT gear that you know is a far cry from the facility that will be hosting it, or for an application that doesn’t even need such level of availability and resilience that you built into your new facility, again you have wasted your company’s resources. Always getting the facility teams to align their developments with the ‘true’ needs of the IT and ensuring that IT comprehends the realities of the facilities is a challenge. But it is crucial that both ends of the compromise are fully aware of the consequence of the choices made, as they relate to each other.</p>
                <h5>Time vs. Money</h5>
                <p>So often, projects are delayed due to budgets not getting released in time, contractors and vendor payments being delayed, or IT managers end-up settling for inferior designs and technologies due to lack of funds. All of this costs data center experts time, and time is money. Also, often enough, to save money, we spend less time in properly designing or planning our data center. That lack of ample preparation gets us wrong assessments of the realities we will ultimately face and thus everything in the lifecycle of the data center becomes an unanticipated challenge rather than a routine and foreseen task. Therefore, we end up spending both further time and money into the same subject and in damage control instead of a progressive and efficient operations regime that becomes our operational culture. The more time we spend in advance preparations, the less money we will end up spending during the life of a data center; and the more funds we provide to our necessary needs, the less time we need to invest in alterations and getting around problems.</p>
                <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
                    <img src="/2-timevsmoney.jpg" width={'350px'} />
                </div>
                <h5>CapEx vs. OpEx</h5>
                <p>It is a fact that lower initial cost (CapEx) doesn’t necessarily warrant lower total cost of ownership. Data center is not something you buy once and shelf it. It is a live being that will continuously generate cost/benefit results by the measure of its live operation. Data center is one of those things that cost of running it can end-up being more than building it. It is not enough to look at the price tag of your systems to decide if such system is financially feasible for your organization. What drives cost of ownership is the upfront costs as well as operating costs over the life expectancy of the data center [TCO = CapEx + (OpEx * DC Useful Life)]. Therefore for every system or component of your data center, you must find the right balance between both capital as well as operating expenditures to run an equilibrium data center.</p>
                <h4>Data center is a business of equilibriums!</h4>
                <p>All of the above mentioned parameters could also be interlinked and served against one another. For example, running low on capacity can directly influence your efficiency; implementing higher security can compromise your efficiency; higher resilience could hamper safety, and so on. Furthermore, the above and certainly more factors are KPIs that you must balance to achieve your equilibrium data center. Hence, there are tons of controversies in each state of data center design, build and operation. From your site selection, to cooling and power design, to IT parameters and operational disciplines, all the way to consolidation and green initiatives, they all require a series of equilibrium decisions that results in a balance of the above.</p>
                <p>If you have been involved in any one of the mentioned scenarios and failed to achieve a balance, don’t worry you are not alone. Many fall short in aligning or making their data center compromises feasible. What’s important for you is to obtain a clear grasp for the opportunity-cost of your every choice and the consequences you would expect thereof. Remember, that data center is a business of equilibriums! This means that you must achieve a state of assurance by convening perfect balance between diverging forces. Your application ecosystem is a symphony of equilibriums, a balanced harmony of your optimized choices…</p>

                <h5>Do we need data center standards?</h5>
                <p>Data centers are being built at a rapid pace beyond our comprehension. They are also transforming at a staggering speed. Sometimes having rules, guidelines and methodologies that are measurable and applicable are liberating. They are liberating in the sense that they provide a clear-cut approach and the necessary tools for organizations and professionals to measure their efficacies. Absence of these standards will create anarchy and an anomaly that will be hard to manage. If there were no rule of law and consensus on preset agreed-upon guidelines, there would be chaos at each traffic light; disorder, commotion and uncertainty would dominate the atmosphere. The same applies to the information technology, big data, IoT, cloud, and data centers. Without a cohesive and universally acceptable set of standards, disasters will erupt beyond our ability to deal with them. The more we virtualize and the more we transform to digitization, the heavier our reliance on our data centers will inevitably be. Therefore, the lack of common understanding and common sense approach towards data centers will be an expensive proposition. Most of such expense will be paid for by the “end-users” of the data centers. End-users are truly the ones who suffer the most because they have no way of comparing apples and oranges, or quantifying the actual service and performance they would be recipients of. When every provider uses a different benchmark for design, implementation and operation, end-users won’t know how to rate or compare the offering of one provider vs. another, when it comes to the selection of site, facility, IT infrastructure, compute or any layers of the application ecosystem (AE). Standards would fill that gap by providing a common language, a common norm and a common understanding at the horizontal and vertical junction and interchange of all the AE layers.</p>
                <h4>Standards provide a common language, a common norm and a common understanding.</h4>
                <p>When technicians move from one company to the next, the smallest things that require adaptation to new standards, which dictate company’s data center culture, can be detrimental to the organization and their job security. Seemingly ordinary issues such as labeling or color scheme for cables confuses them, and at times of emergency or panic results in them pulling the wrong cable, because their mind subconsciously thinks red is crossover, for example. Wouldn’t it be sane if everyone used a common matrix so that they could spend less money to change the culture of their new recruits? Also, when speaking to your potential clients, vendors, providers, peers, affiliates, etc., having a common language simply makes sense. This industry is wasting so many resources because IT doesn’t understand facilities, facility doesn’t correspond to IT, commercial data centers don’t relate to their own audience, government doesn’t know where to begin and how/what to benchmark itself against to save all this waste of resources. Standards establish that common understanding, a preset set of acceptable rules and methods by which everyone is presumed to comply with. If we want to know how important standards are, we must think about how much we are loosing by not possessing them. Those losses are mind-boggling today, and the curve is inclining towards the future.</p>
                <h5>Do we have applicable standards?</h5>
                <p>It is imperative for any industry to, ultimately, follow a common set of standards. However, not having standards is far better than having numerous contradictory, out-of-date, out-of-touch and impractical standards. Such standards will lead us into an illusion, thinking that we actually do have standards that we can utilize; yet following them will be even more tragic. Sadly enough, this is the story of the data center industry today. We have tens of so-called standards and best practices that talk about data centers without really understanding their essence, or vivid biases towards cabling, power, cooling, civil, security, etc. instead of having a truly holistic and multidimensional data center approach. Therefore, the existing standards, end up doing more damage than good. They confuse consultants, they delay stakeholders, and they damage the industry’s health and prosperity by a landslide.</p>
                <h5>What are the characteristics of an effective standard?</h5>
                <p>An effective standard is the one that reviews the past, but addresses today and possesses the capacity to digest the future. Standards should reflect the future as much as they talk about the past. We don’t need the standards to remind us of traditions. Traditions are only useful when they are applicable and logically make sense to still be implemented. Typically, we evaluate our past but stay there and do not move beyond it. Such historic reviews and analysis are useful only when they would be a reflection into our lives today by the lessons learnt. At the same time, any standard that locks itself into the present looses the capacity to accept and welcome the future that is right around the corner.</p>
                <h4>An effective standard is the one that reviews the past, but addresses today and possesses the capacity to digest the future.</h4>
                <p>An effective standard doesn’t stress solely on one path for doing things, rather paves the way for further development and progress. A true solution is not the one that gives you a finite result, rather a dynamic methodology that enables you to achieve infinite results. Educating people to produce optimum solutions of their own is far more enriching and valuable than rendering one solution whose optimism could already be at the verge of expiry.</p>
                <h4>A true solution is not the one that gives you a finite result, rather a dynamic methodology that enables you to achieve infinite results.</h4>
                <p>An effective standard makes complex problems simple to digest and solve, not make simple problems difficult to understand and resolve. Standards should make life simple, not more difficult. Generally speaking, standards tend to make the simplest forms of an industry’s challenge sound so convoluted that nobody, with exception of an elite few, would want to give the resolution of it an attempt. Complexity is nothing but aggregation of simplicities bundled in a greater relation to each other than their individual forms. A practical standard must decompose those complex bundles into simple forms and reverse-engineer complex methods into simplified logic, which can be comprehended by those who need to use it.</p>
                <h4>Complexity is nothing but aggregation of simplicities bundled in a greater relation to each other than their individual forms.</h4>
                <p>An effective standard should promote and encourage innovation not limit it. Typically, people who want to get ahead, travel far and reach untapped territories of progress and success, often times, are tied and pulled back due to rusted and obsolete methods that serve very little good today. It is key to understand that the only way forward for us is continuous QI and innovation. Having only a mindset for innovation is not sufficient by itself. Possessing standards that provide a framework to foster and enable innovation is necessary.</p>
                <h4>An effective standard should promote and encourage innovation not limit it. Possessing standards that provide a framework to foster and enable innovation is necessary.</h4>
                <p>An effective standard should not limit you, rather liberate you from the wrong doings of the past and provide proven techniques to optimize your choices. Therefore, a standard should not lock you into a design, or put a glass ceiling on your head and box your capacity to grow, innovate and develop things further than the visions and capacities of the developers of the standard itself. In essence, the standard should provide best practice examples, but more importantly provide optimized methodologies to boost creativity and enhancement of the existing methods.</p>
                <h4>An effective standard should not limit you, rather liberate you from the wrong doings of the past and provide proven techniques to optimize your choices.</h4>
                <p>An effective standard must not be biased towards a specific efficacy such as availability or security. Rather it must be the remedy for optimizing all applicable efficacies and provide fertile ground for availability, capacity, resilience, safety, security, efficiency and innovation. When witnessing how a given organization is focally focused around a given efficacy, such as solely being security-tight, or availability-conscious, the standard that the organization follows is easily revealed. Usually those bias tendencies tend to ignore other efficacies that are as important to the faith of the organization and long-term interests of the industry.</p>
                <h4>Standards must be the remedy for optimizing all applicable efficacies and provide fertile ground for availability, capacity, resilience, safety, security, efficiency and innovation.</h4>
                <p>An effective standard must also be unbiased towards any specific technology, design, discipline, specialty or region. Standards can be universally acceptable and thus serve as a common language and a bridge between different disciplines, regions, etc., when they are not bias. To build a standard that only a few can relate to is defeating the purpose. Therefore, standards must be comprehensive enough to cover the entire application ecosystem stack, internationally applicable, and adaptable enough to be localizable to different industries as well as geographic regions.</p>
                <h5>Who should write data center standards?</h5>
                <p>Well, if the common standardization organizations knew any better, they would have developed standards that address this industry’s needs years ago. When they don’t move, stakeholders have but few options: either to put them aside and just follow their internal processes and self-proclaimed proprietary methodologies; pick and choose from the numerous existing documents to their liking and copy/paste from here and there; stick to one rusted, bias and narrow-sighted standard; or those who know better that none of the above choices are really an option for this industry and care to do something concrete about it, come together and build a standard that makes sense for everybody.</p>
                <p>It doesn’t matter who writes standards. What matters is, does that organization, individual or group of individuals attempting it, offer solutions to our problems. Is there an unwritten law somewhere that says standards must be written by those organizations that have failed to addressed our needs till date? If such entities are too slow or lack the resources, vision etc. to keep up with our industry, should we sit idle and let the industry suffer? What if we knew better and have better means than our predecessors? What if they are too tied up in their ways or possibly influenced by some vendors who hate change? Or, are they simply too bureaucratic and arrogant to be useful to the world’s most dynamic and fast moving industry?</p>
                <p>So… we have started this movement that, frankly, should have been commenced a while ago. We will not rest till this industry finds its roots, understands its true purpose, defines clear roles and objectives for professionals living and working within it, provides clear assurances to the service recipients, becomes established and well-grounded on sustainable modern era principles. Again, it doesn’t matter who writes data center standards and with what ambition or even who writes them first. What is of substance here, is that the content of the upcoming standard must be the solution to our problems today and forward-looking enough to last us a while…</p>
                <h4>Our industry must find its roots, understand its true purpose, define clear roles and objectives for professionals living and working within it, provide clear assurances to the service recipients, become rooted and well grounded on sustainable modern era principles.</h4>

                <p>The very pillar of capitalism is the open market system whereby supply is driven by demand – Econ101. This is when a group of so-called “elite” don’t sit and engineer what needs to be supplied to their liking. It is when the economic driver is the pull of demand, not the push of supply. But, what happens when demand is driven by supply? In such a case, what can be expected when the system breaks down by its very own conceptions?</p>
                <p>It used to be that customer expectations were key. Enterprises centered their innovations and investments around customers’ expectations, not around what they would like customers to expect. Maybe that’s why capitalism “used to” work and that’s exactly why it has been crippled by its own making. The very conglomerates and gigantic enterprises that were the wheels of the capitalist economy have reached a point whereby they define what needs to be supplied. In the past, furniture, cars, and other products were designed to last. But when vendors design products to fail at an expected time, Mean Time Before Failure (MTBF), do we ask for more durability? Or, do we happily replace our recently purchased merchandise as frequently as possible?</p>
                <p>For any system to work, the essential algorithms sustaining its foundations must deliver as assumed. When the fundamental assumptions of a system are no longer valid—in this case capitalism—does the rule of supply and demand still apply? In short, is what we demand to our interest, or not?</p>
                <p>The converse drive of the supply-and-demand rule is the earthquake that shakes the bedrock of our capitalist societies. In our world today, the question remains: is supply driven by demand or is demand driven by supply?</p>
                <h4>Is supply driven by demand or is demand driven by supply?</h4>
                <p>In the data center world, for example, a manufacturer devises cold-aisle containment for better cooling in data centers. People follow it for a while. The same vendor comes out after a few years, with hot-aisle containment and what do we do? We follow that. Most people don’t even know the difference, nor which is better or even any being an ideal cooling optimization solution to begin with; Apple releases a new iPhone, a few months after the release of the previous version. We rush back in the lines and are proud to be standing in long queues to repurchase our phone yet again; All of us have been to restaurants where they aim to impress you with a big plate of sauce, a splash of salt and pepper and a decorative design of a leaf of basil but, come think of it, there is so little content in the center of a big and colorful, yet practically empty plate. We pay big bucks and somehow sallow air, instead of actual food along with a feeling of uncertainty wrapped with cognitive belief of fulfillment; Last but not least example: everyday we see our politicians make senseless remarks, as redundant as they get, as vague as they could possibly be, and as contradictory to the very nature of their own parties and communities, and yet their standing in the polls goes up.</p>
                <p>Have we ever thought, why it is that we can still watch old and rusted movies and at times enjoy them more than most of the new releases that are the result of all sorts of technological advancements? Why? Is it for the camera lenses, the acting or the scenery? What could it be other than deep stories, values and the simple “innocence” that are hard to find in today’s movies? But somehow we have become convinced that if a film has a famous crew, a big budget, lots of noise, and utilized the latest technology, it has got to be what we want to watch, regardless of its substance or content. Hence, our entertainment business has no limits. We pay all kinds of costs to be entertained. We give away, liberty, wisdom, innovation, health and security to be entertained. Life-consuming entertainment has found its roots not only in our routine TV series, shows and programs but also in the serious matters revolving around our livelihood, including our socio-political atmosphere. An average viewer’s perspective of the presidential debates signifies how, even the most critical matters that touch economical development, social prosperity, even national security, have become subject of entertainment for a nation that is world’s number one supper-power both in terms of riches and debt.</p>
                <p>Do we get supplied with what we demand, or are we demanding what we are being supplied? Are we constantly being fed what the suppliers deem best, for which we become consumers of, or are we demanding what we deem best and get that supplied to us? Do we even know what we want? Do we know better? Or, do “they” know better?</p>
                <h4>This key question is the crucial matter by which nations, societies, cultures, industries, cultures, communities and individuals within them are affected.</h4>
                <p>Aren’t suppliers the very root-cause of how the majority of our industries look and perform? Does media supply us what we demand or constantly feed us what, subconsciously, becomes our demand?</p>
                <p>Because the interests of suppliers are not necessarily aligned with those of end-users, and because we are often made to believe that what they supply is what we demand, these seemingly minor diversions accumulate such that we are simply led to consume products that are not aligned with our true demand. Therefore, a lack of moral, lack of wisdom and lack of substance widen their presence in our lives. We become fashion-driven, meaning vendors showcase us something and we demand just that, no questions asked.</p>
                <p>For as long we remain the consumers of the interests of our suppliers, instead of consumers of our own demand, we will not progress to a world that is better suited for us.</p>

                <p>When liberal economy and trade meant traveling between borders, creating the Russia’s Iron Curtain or Germany’s Berlin Wall seemed like a political remedy to safeguard certain sociopolitical hemispheres. But those latter policies and the erection of those barriers were proven disastrous to their citizens and the world around them.</p>
                <p>Looks like history has to repeat itself no matter what. Recently Russia announced that Russia’s data must stay in Russia. In the United States, we have strict rules governing data safekeeping within our borders for industries like healthcare, finance, etc. Are these practical policies? Can these policies be sustained in the revitalizing information age? How can Cloud impact—or be impacted—by these policies?</p>
                <p>Without going any further, let us bluntly say that data cannot be confined within borders. Though data is more valuable, it is not equivalent to gold in terms of tangibility, that can be transported on the back of trailers and stored in Fort Knox. Before banks were invented, people kept their money under their pillows. But as soon as money started to be deposited in banks, people practically lost tangible control over it and transactions among banks became a vivid norm. When we say we want to keep our data within our borders, it is synonymous to saying that we want to keep our money under our pillow. For as long as data is kept in paper copies, the concept of keeping physical borders can be practiced. But as soon as data is digitized, we encounter an entirely different realm of realities.</p>
                <h4>If we put too much focus on physical security, we will lose its availability sooner or later.</h4>
                <p>What’s critical about digitizing data is that—as intangible as it is—if we put too much focus on physical security, we will lose its availability sooner or later. When data is transformed into a logical being, it must be kept secure and dealt with in its logical form. Storing data in data centers that are within the circle of our trusted allies goes a long way in securing our own interests. That’s what allies are for. We have traditionally exchanged goods, services and knowhow with our trusted allies. Now information is a key substance that must be physically trusted abroad while being logically secured at the home base.</p>
                <p>The IRS hack of 2015 was a national disaster that happened with the breach of the confines of the cyber world—it was not a physical border sabotage. The 2014 hacking of Target following Black Friday, which affected 110 million customers, didn’t happen by an American in the United States. It ensued out of Russia (by a 17-year old) under the watch of a security team situated in Bangalore, India. This denotes that regardless of their race, gender, age or location, hackers don’t first search for the location of your data center to see if your physical location matches their jurisdiction and citizenship before initiating an attack. It means that your data does not need to be in Russia to be hacked by a Russian or vice versa. By the same token, due to the intangible and borderless nature of data, Target for example, didn’t mind their security team to be manned out of India.</p>
                <p>It is critical to understand that the nature of data, once it is digitized, is logical—not physical. Therefore, any extent of physical fortification is futile in the sense that it doesn’t address the natural essence of what it is trying to protect. On the contrary, we could reverse this cross-border liberation to our advantage if we built clouds of physical locations around the world and seeded vital data globally in an arrangement so that theft at a physical data center node, at any given location (even the IRS’s main infrastructure), would not provide criminals with access to the logical data they seek. Thus, we could be using this diversity of locations to our security benefit. Security professionals must give this point a serious thought…</p>
                <h4>We could be using this diversity of locations to our security benefit.</h4>
                <p>Today, life revolves around information and whatever that goes along with it. This means that when you travel you want your information to securely travel with you. So, our great minds of data integrity and security must work on key remedies for the root-cause of the problem—that is establishing data security, not putting physical borders around a substance that knows no physical borders.</p>
                <h4>Establishing actual data security is key, not attempting to place borders around a substance that knows no physical boundaries.</h4>
                <p>Total information security will only be achieved if we can finally merge the physical aspects of data with its logical, and leverage its physical diversity to cultivate dynamic logical security that would be impossible otherwise. Ultimately, cyber criminals will walk into a total darkness from which they would not be able to make sense or conclude with legitimate information. This is a security state which can best be described by a piece from the world-renowned poet and mystic, Rumi:</p>
                <h4>“SOME Hindus had brought an elephant for exhibition and placed it in a dark house. Crowds of people were entering into that dark place to see it. Finding that ocular inspection was impossible, each visitor felt it with his palm in the darkness.
                    The palm of one fell on the trunk.
                    ‘This creature is like a water-spout,’ he said.
                    The hand of another lighted on the elephant’s ear. To him the beat was evidently like a fan.
                    Another rubbed against its leg.
                    ‘I found the elephant’s shape is like a pillar,’ he said.
                    Another laid his hand on its back.
                    ‘Certainly this elephant was like a throne,’ he said.
                    The sensual eye is just like the palm of the hand. The palm has not the means of covering the whole of the essence. The eye of the sea is one thing and the foam another. Let the foam go, and gaze with the eye of the sea. Day and night foam-flecks are flung from the sea: of amazing! You behold the foam but not the sea. We are like boats dashing together; our eyes are darkened, yet we are in clear water.”
                </h4>
                <p>Mystic interpretations and true intentions of this narrative aside, game-changing content/data protection philosophies and methodologies could be derived from this divine reality.</p>
                <p>The world we live in has become so impractical simply because we are on the verge of adopting the information technology—the extent and breadth of which we are yet to understand. We are using modern-day information technology assets and applications hosted in billion-dollar data centers, but are following the governing policies that were relevant for when we were dealing with pen and paper. There must come an awakening of realities that the governance of pen and paper traditions over digital media will fail with catastrophic consequences.</p>

                <p>The world as we know it is transforming into something of a different nature. A nature that is not natural by the benchmark of our predecessors. This transformation is changing the way we bond, work, interact, and live. If watching too much TV was of a topic of concern a few years ago, now overwhelming consumption of computers and apps is in focus. Even TVs are nowadays another IP-based device that sit on the network of your transformed life.</p>
                <p>What is the root cause of our lives’ transformation? The answer used to be agriculture, followed by industrialization, and more recently technology. But if we dig deep enough, we realize that the real paradigm shift is happening on account of information technology. Information age, information management, information availability, information security, and information-driven life are all derivatives of what information technology has made available to us.</p>
                <p>Question is: how are information technology capabilities actually delivered? Via numerous means obviously, but at the core of it all, data centers shine. Information and its related technologies could not cater to any of us if not for the application ecosystem made available through data centers. Data centers are like the element of steel for construction of modern bridges, or bedrock of oceans for drilling oil, or the Amazon forest for supplying oxygen to Earth. With every activity you sign up for, every bill you pay, every app you use, your information is processed through data centers.</p>
                <p>Information technology norms, terms, technologies, virtualization and cloud are all nice to hear and talk about, but how are they ultimately being delivered in a tangible form? Data centers. So, data centers are the living atmosphere and platform for information technology. Data centers are the enabling and sustaining core element that allows information technology to drive the transformation that is happening around us at a pace beyond our capacity for adaptation to change.</p>
                <h4>Data centers are the enabling and sustaining core element that allows information technology to drive the transformation that is happening around us at a pace beyond our capacity for adaptation to change.</h4>
                <p>In the rest of this blog, I will examine the true impact of data-center-enabled-information-technology on “life” as we know it:</p>

                            Social impact – When DVRs are recording your every move, passports are chipped, your phone tracks and records your conversations and whereabouts, will theft, betrayal, cheating, or crime be committed without a second thought? The biblical narrative cautions its followers to the record-keeping of angels. A believer in the unseen would take heed. Today, tracking, tracing, and recording devices are watching you with ever-improving precision and your slightest misconduct can easily breach their thresholds. This is synonymous to running a traffic light or speeding knowing that cameras are present. So, consequences are: citizens of a civil society will be extra careful to preserve their interests in the present lives which they hold sacred, whether they believe in the hereafter or not. Hence, conservatism will escalate and ethical values come to surface all because God’s once-promised angels are now actually at the service of law-enforcement and social services. Meanwhile, there are other enormous changes in the social arena, including in the way we meet, greet, and bond with people through social media and other information technology-driven social capacities. Additionally, the vast array of sensitive detection systems and real-time monitoring and surveillance, alerting, and response systems used, for example, for fire and flood detection, security, and dispatch of emergency crews, vehicles, law-enforcement, news and media etc., has provided a safety shield around our lives to an extent that did not exist before. All of this is made possible by information technology using data centers as its platform of reliability and execution.

                            Economic impact –If it were not for the dotcoms and information-based businesses, the American economy would have been officially bankrupt years ago. The traditional wheels of our economy (heavy industries, such as war, oil and manufacturing) do not turn as productively as they used to. No longer can starting a war somewhere or selling cars and refrigerators to households sustain a thriving economy. The new age has brought forth new drivers of economic development and productivity. Even the world’s number one source of production, China, has realized this shift and is betting on its dotcoms such as Baidu and Alibaba. In the light of consistent failure of most traditional economic plans and norms, the American economy and way of life is still vibrant because of the likes of Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook or, for that mater, any successful business operating on the backbone of information technology. Where would any of them be without their data centers? Information technology is creating jobs and raising the skill level of the entire workforce, resulting in higher pay and elevated standards of living. Moreover, information technology-based careers are amongst the most rewarding; interestingly enough, some of the best-paid employees in non-IT companies are its IT personnel. Economies that bank on this very reality and cultivate their data farms and data-driven industries will similarly harvest the greatest rewards. I will address this very topic and how economies can benefit from this transformation in a later blog.

                            Political impact – In the ancient world, leaders would poise plots against one another or make decisions that impact nations on a large scale, while all of that could remain hidden. Today, some of the most powerful people on Earth cannot even make slightly questionable personal decisions without thinking twice because they can easily be caught. This information age where information technology is empowering all levels of the society to gain vivid access to most hidden practices of the past in present times will become the root cause of government cleansing. It is widely felt that a politician in higher office has stepped on the hearts and rights of many to reach the stage he/she is at today. Notions such as “politicians are dirty”, “politics is corrupt” and so forth will be obsolete as we progress through time riding the information technology vehicle. Information technology has enabled companies, for example, to assess the personal characteristic of their employees by linking to their social media pages and seeing if who they really are matches who they pretend to be. With IP tracking embedded in almost every living thing, a political advocate will have a digitized transcript of his or her habits, places visited, acts conducted, items purchased, medicine consumed, and much more over his/her lifespan. Hence, privacy issues aside, there will come a time where, in the context of free and open societies, politicians will be amongst the most pure and sincere individuals. When politicians purify, biased policies and agendas will be pushed to the sidelines and finally the ruling elite will intend to act solely to the benefit of their citizens.

                            Knowledge impact – finding information in abundance, being able to freely browse different opinions, search, and compare ideas are all but some of the benefits that this global transformation has brought forth. Going to school or college online, attending virtual courses and workshops and obtaining knowledge, degrees and certifications is made possible more than ever with eLearning. Many now have access to schools and receive a level of education that was not feasible in the past. Access to powerful search is a massive shift in our way of life. Information, which was often retrieved through complicated and time-consuming processes, is now available at the tip of your fingers. With a simple search on your tablet, laptop, or phone you can get such diverse, cohesive, and alternative sources of information that you would not have access to if you spent hours searching in libraries. In short, efficiency in knowledge-acquisition as in wider, simpler, and faster access to knowledge is made possible, realistically, at a magnitude beyond expectations. Information is not only accessible more widely and at a faster pace, it is also presented more effectively and dynamically, enabling learning aids while offering comparative analysis and tools that were unavailable before. Where is all this knowledge stored, processed, and retrieved from? Nowhere other than data centers.

                            Historical impact – how many pages of human history and civilization have been fuel for wild fires or destroyed and rewritten by victors? All of what we think of our past, in reality could be the opposite or somewhat different from what the minimal historical records indicate. Losing history could be as simple as losing family photos, or as complex as losing court cases, police reports, patient records, forensic evidence, etc. With correct information technology foundations and effective data center design, build and management, the elimination of historical records would need to be outright engineered. Especially with the virtualization and cloud, if implemented correctly according to modern data center practices across the site and facility layers (refer to Infinity Paradigm™), information technology can make it impossible for pages of history or records that need up-keeping to be boiled down to single physical sites/locations that are vulnerable to disasters or errors that have struck and impacted our history in the past. Thus, valuable data about us, our past, and our present can be preserved and, so, we can uphold our integrity for the future to come.

                            Communication impact – effective and cost-efficient communication is key to the development and evolution of humankind. Not only do businesses take advantage of new means of communication, reducing their OpEx and time/effort for traveling, meetings etc., but also populations at large living in different corners of this global village can now interact more or less freely and real-time. The evolution of telegraphs, to telex, fax, modem, then prepaid calling cards, VoIP, later on Skype, Viber, WhatsApp, and other means of online communication has brought people from around the world closer to one-another at a staggering pace. News from one corner of the world is transmitted, distributed, read, and responded to real-time. This has greatly induced the impact factor of every event, situation or news that gets produced at a global scale to a point that the promise of allowing open social media presence, can be one president’s ticket to office in some countries these days. Modern-day communication is supplied in abundance while its demand is even more overwhelming. What used to be a regional event can now create global empathy, global campaigns, and global resolve due the availability of communication. Broader events such as global warming, wars, riots, widespread diseases as well as positive news of all sorts reach us at a speed unimaginable by our predecessors. All of this said and done, none of our telcos, news, broadcasting, and social media companies would be where they are today nor would they be delivering the services they are offering if it were not for applications that live in the ecosystem that data centers deliver. All of what makes our modern lives possible today is due to data centers and how it enables information and the technologies related to it.

                <p>It is clear that our lives are evolving at a rapid rate towards betterment. Note that this new transformation does not come without sacrifice. There are side effects and changes in lifestyle, in other words opportunity cost with strings attached. This means that potentially all of what is happening could not necessarily be in our best interest. I will talk about this in a future blog. Nevertheless, the pros outweigh the cons, and our life, as we know it, is being directly impacted and driven by information technology, which is made available and delivered by data centers worldwide. The moral of this surfacing truth is that our world today, and more so in the future, will be fostering evolution of all walks of life, aiding activists striving to push reforms against dictators or rusted systems that have passed the stage of obsolescence; economists pondering on the issue of jobs, quality of life, and GDP; or law enforcement trying to avoid mistakes, improve speed and precision; and fostering eLearning, eGovernment, eHealth, … eLife. Ultimately, for this to materialize, information technology with data centers as its beating heart is delivering data up and down the information vessels of our transformed life.</p>

                <p>We have seen so many papers and opinions on this very question and redundant topic: “top 10 reasons why your data center goes down”, “top 5 things you should do to prevent downtime”, “top root-causes of data center outage”. It has become more of an entertainment and game of numbers to see who comes up with a newer version or more reasons for the same question. My intent in this blog is to put an end to the rhetoric. Truth is, source of data center failures has many facets but one root-cause.</p>
                <h4>Source of data center failures has many facets but one root-cause.</h4>
                <p>There is only one root-cause of data center failures and one root-cause only: People. “The people” who design, plan, run, operate and own data centers are the depth of all problems that surface different representations in the events of failure:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>“People” not understanding the business – It is very typical of data centers to deliver something different from, or in some cases in total contradiction with the business needs. Most people don’t even know what it is that they really want when they attempt to quantify their needs to the data center matrices. Not understanding the nature of the business, its requirements and sensitivities is the beginning of all problems.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>“People” not sizing the right budget – When you need four nines (99.99%) of availability but your budget is sized for two and a half nines (99.45%) only; when you need 2MW of power but your budget only allows you to procure 1.5MW; when you know the effective cooling for your specific case is to supply of 15KW per rack and 2,400 CFM, but your budget only provides you purchasing power for a fraction of what you really need; who is at fault but the people who diverted the budget from the actual needs and the people who accepted this unrealistic compromised and provided false guarantees?</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>“People” selecting the wrong sites – If an earthquake, flood, tornado or any other weather anomaly takes a data center down; if extreme temperatures, dust, EMI, etc. burden a data center with hefty energy bills and potential downtimes; or if you lack redundant utilities and access providers, it’s because people involved in the site-selection didn’t do their homework or compromised for an inferior site but failed to relay the potential consequences up to the management ladder.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>“People” crafting fallacious designs – Design flaws are a common source of problems that reflect down the operations floor in mega folds when and where you need the data center the most. Inappropriate engineering, inadequate conceptual and detail designing lead to a chain of deficiencies in the data center that are too expensive to change and rectify once construction is completed and nearly impossible to handle in events of failure.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>“People” buying inappropriate technologies – When people select and procure products based on brands and not their substance; when they try to build their data center around a specific product or technology, rather than building the data center and its encompassing technologies around the application and the business; or when a technology that is selected is not optimum for the specifications of the data center, problem is the people in the chain of command who ignore the basic principles of fundamental data center builds.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>“People” doing incorrect implementations – Ignoring correct and methodological implementation principles, cutting corners, overlooking details, not being punctual, missing critical installation procedures and configuration phases, are only a fragment of the pilling disasters for the to-be-live data center, and more so, the stakeholders of the data center and end-users of the application.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>“People” failing to test – Proper testing is a necessary critical step in data center development. If not planned and excused with expertise, it will result in false promises and wrong beliefs in the data center delivery claims and abilities. People involved in the test engineering, planning, execution, supervision and post-test report evaluation and decision-making process are key in ensuring effective tests and corrective measures to avoid serious shortages and failures over time.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>“People” depending on the wrong people – When a DBA moves up to manage a data center without proper exposure and training, when a network engineer assumes the role of data center ops manager, when an electrical expert takes the role of data center strategist or when a mechanical engineer runs a helpdesk, then “Houston, we have a problem.” Many times, people grow into their positions and the new positions they assume are a far cry from their true capabilities and what they can deliver. Depending on the wrong people can prove disastrous for data centers. Data centers need to be planned, implemented and ran by data center people, period.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>“People” failing to document – The lack of concise and cohesive operation manuals, consolidated SOPs, policies and procedures, implementation of effective change control, owning and managing solid, yet simple and practical documentation can take a whole system down and prove the lack of proper documentation to be a very expensive proposition. Again, who else is behind this shortcoming but the people involved?</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>“People” misaligning IT and Facilities –  The misalignment of data center facilities (power, cooling, etc.) in relation to the IT (network, storage, etc.) has caused too much damage and wasted too many resources as well as operational hours beyond description. We have far breached the borders of obsolescence when still facing this traditional and unjustified misalignment in data centers. Unfortunately, widely practiced by people, this continues to be a visible and consistent gap across organizations.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>“People” failing to plan ahead – Data centers are supposed to empower and sustain business growth. Thus, being futuristic in vision and practice as well as planning for the upcoming needs (as best as they can be projected) given today’s dynamism of businesses and applications, is crucial. Not planning ahead, not just in anticipation of growth and expansion, but also for consolidation, disaster and recovery management, and many other aspects is caused by the short-sightedness of people.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>“People” not implementing true cloud – Going cloud is the way of achieving new horizons and satisfying extreme RPO and RTO values.   But cloud cannot be taken solely by its virtual sense. True cloud is the essential requirement for catering to today’s needs of mission-critical applications. When people don’t understand what cloud is, in physical and logical terms as well as how it is to be implemented, the virtualization realm can mislead IT managers into believing in redundancies that in reality don’t exist.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>“People” being single-point-of-failure – When a critical function of a data center becomes dependent on a single individual, that individual is a single-point-of-failure of your data center. In the event of failure, either due to gross negligence, honest mistakes or simply the absence of that one person; the entire data center, infrastructure, and operations of the business can come to a halt, all due to the lack of redundancy and resiliency management in people.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>“People” not understanding the Application – The application is the ultimate product, delivery or output of the data centers. Application is the reason we build data centers. Unfortunately, people’s lack of tangible comprehension of the application’s true needs drives organizations to build data centers that are geared for anything but the application they intend to deliver. The results are financially sever and easily quantifiable.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>This analogy can continue beyond the above notes, linking all shortages of the data center to the people planning and executing data centers. The lack of knowledge, expertise, knowhow, passion, precision, devotion, attention, consultation, teamwork, efforts and investments vested in such, drives data centers to the edge of destruction, causing catastrophes for their stakeholders.</p>
                <p>The resulting mishaps and mistakes caused by those who are simply not qualified to design, implement and run multi-MW facilities and/or lack the comprehensive approach to all data center components such as power, cooling, civil, telecom, IT, safety, security, application, etc., have proven devastating to data centers, people, infrastructure and businesses. All these and more are just some of the defects of weak “people” management.</p>
                <h4>All shortages and data center defects are linked to weak “people” management.</h4>
                <p>The reverse of this impulse is a valid and potential reality. Let it be known that, the same root cause of failures can be the organization’s data center edge, whereby having the right people in the right places will get the data center to successful results of capacity, efficiency, security, safety, availability and resilience. Therefore, the most state-of-the-art data center infrastructure without the appropriate people planning, managing and operating it, is a recipe for destruction, while the same infrastructure with the appropriate people is logically a clear recipe for success.</p>
                <h4>The most state-of-the-art data center infrastructure without the appropriate people planning, managing and operating it, is a recipe for destruction.</h4>
                <p>This notion applies to all walks of life, where our public policies, political system, economy and social system, education, welfare, health and safety, are given direction to and driven by people, hopefully for the people. If we have subject matter experts who are qualified, passionate, sincere and committed individuals in the right positions, the lives of our citizens would undertake more productive and fruitful journeys.</p>
                <p>Back to data centers: the most brilliant people can’t deliver all the availabilities, efficiencies and securities you ask for without the proper infrastructure. Nevertheless, if you invest more on infrastructure than you do on your people, the inherited deficit you whereby create in your overall data center will provide you false assurances and widen the gap between the infrastructure and your people even more.  So next time you plan to buy up infrastructure, take a moment to think, evaluate your human resources, balance your emphasis and always invest in your people first!</p>

                <p>The data center world has heard and wasted enough resources over the wrong emphasis placed on the facility aspects of the data center, while not witnessed merely enough attention on the data center’s merit, purpose and true output. So often, we are overwhelmed by the extensive focus on “power” (UPS, ATS, Generators, Busbars, etc.), or “cooling” (free-cooling, hybrid cooling, CRACs, CRAHs, chillers, liquid cooling, in-rack cooling, in-row cooling, etc.), structured “cabling”, physical “security”, site and “building”, and so forth. But despite their importance, these parameters do not deal with “data” directly. What has been ignored for decades and unfortunately continues to be ignored in most data center principles and guidelines, is the Information Technology (IT) side of the equation, which is the actual infrastructure dealing with the data and application. Moreover, virtualization and cloud are other critical parameters that are practically above and beyond the knowledge and vision of facility-minded “data” center practitioners.</p>
                <h4>Information Technology (IT), is the actual infrastructure that deals directly with the data and application.</h4>
                <p>There is a story behind this backwardness. It all started when people used to call IBM and asked it to build a data center for them. Whatever IBM said or did was fine with people, because the bulk of their data center and the core of their investment were vested into mainframes. Then, as the technology progressed, other IT vendors such as HP, Cisco, Microsoft, Sun Microsystems (Oracle), came to the picture and said “wait a minute, we can build data centers for you too”. In time, the industry realized these IT vendors don’t have a clue on how to power and cool data centers and went to the other extreme. The extreme that we are living in today is the power and cooling syndrome that is wasting many talents and resources in the data center arena.</p>
                <p>People build a warehouse and fill it up with a bunch of generators, chillers and other facilities and then wonder how they’re going to deploy their application on top the infrastructure that they just invested millions to build. The truth of the matter is that power, cooling, cabling, safety, security, civil, architecture, network, storage, etc. are all important, if not as important. They all need to work in harmony and in a proper atmosphere, an ecosystem, that justifies their existence: the application ecosystem.</p>
                <p>When we came up with the idea of the application ecosystem at IDCA, people were astonished: “what does application have to do with data centers?” as if they literally had forgotten the whole point of building data centers. But, the impulse was due. And thus, the notion of “application-centric” data centers was invented.</p>
                <p>According to IDCA, the purpose of data center is delivering “application” and the definition of data center is “the infrastructure that supports the application ecosystem”. What is the application ecosystem? Application Ecosystem is an environment, both physical and virtual, that allows the application to live and operate as it is intended.</p>
                <h4>Application Ecosystem, is an environment, both physical and virtual, that allows the application to live and operate as it is intended.</h4>
                <p>Application can live, exist, “breathe” and interact only in an ecosystem that supports its purpose. Such an ecosystem is vital for application delivery. Data center caters to that need by being the infrastructure that supports the application ecosystem (AE) and its wellbeing.</p>
                <p>If you have a “data” center mindset, you would first analyze the nature and requirements of your application, then build the data center around the application; as apposed to building the data center then try to somehow fit your application around it. Note: we are not advocating that facilities such as power and cooling are unimportant. They are critical. But they have to be designed around and suited for the applications they will be accommodating. Furthermore, as we merge into the world of diversification across the physical sites and implementing true clouds at the topology layer of the application ecosystem, the more the availability role of site-specific power and cooling infrastructure will diminish, and the more the efficiency criteria for such infrastructure will amplify.</p>
                <p>How many data centers have we visited that have 25% to 50% of a 42U rack filled at most, simply because they ran out of power and cooling capacity? How much real estate and human capital is being wasted in the United States and the rest of the world due to this seemingly simple issue? This is not a cooling and power issue!   This is the issue of not building application-centric data centers and instead building data centers that are unnecessarily huge, inefficient, and not fit for the applications they are hosting. On the other extreme, there are those who pileup Kw after Kw into every single rack under the tagline of “high-density” without regard to basic safety parameters and operational conduciveness of such implementations (I will write on the high-density computing, power and cooling later). As a result, with the wrong perspective, we end up with either centers that are built for anything but “data” and application, or centers that host applications in not an optimally safe and sustainable “ecosystem”.</p>
                <h4>For as long as we build power and cooling centers, we cannot accept “data” center results from our investment.</h4>
                <p>For as long as we build power and cooling centers, we cannot accept “data” center results from our investment. This mindset is obsolete for the needs of today and surely inept for the vital necessities of tomorrow.</p>

                <p>How can commercial data centers effectively address the needs of today’s hosting markets and be ready for a future that is just around the corner? Here is some key advice for those who would like to serve the realities of today and the requirements of tomorrow:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Know your audience – The data center field is becoming more and more specialized. The requirements of diverse industry sectors/verticals are widening their gaps between each other. Thus requirements, depending on who’s your audience, in terms of both compliance and priorities, are different. For instance, efficiency might not be as much of a key criterion for the defense as security may be. The reverse of this might be true for education. You cannot build one-size-fits-all data centers and feel good about your cookie-cutter approach. Those days are over. This notion becomes more apparent if we grasp the risks some industries pose to others. For example, building data centers near airports or flight paths is not recommended due to the risks that are associated with the aviation business. But don’t airports have data centers? Of course they do. They build data centers at the airport. It makes sense for them. But does that mean we should convince the defense and the healthcare to host in such data centers? Of course not. Those institutions have their own risks to worry about and do not need to expand their risk-portfolio further. So decide whom you want to have as customers. Banks? Healthcare? Universities? The Secret Service? Understand your customers’ needs as well as what their specific industries demand, then build your data centers to suit those needs. Becoming “client/application-centric” is the bedrock of our industry. This manifest might put you on a whole different route. Perhaps you will end-up providing solely healthcare-specialized data centers, banking-specialized data centers, education-specialized data centers or combination of well-aligned specializations, but surely not a commercial data center for all.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>You cannot build one-size-fits-all data centers and feel good about your cookie-cutter approach. Those days are over.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Educate your people – More frequently than I’d like to, I have been invited to visit data centers and guided by say, the VP of Sales or CEO of the enterprise and the “tour guide” did not know the difference between FM200 and pre-action dry pipe system, Rotary vs Static UPS, CRAH vs CRAC, etc. This vivid poverty in data center knowledge can disseminate itself down to data hall floors in folds by the operating staff, where mistakes could be very expensive. Day by day, your prospective customers are becoming more aware of the data center aspects and components. They are all taking professional training courses and keeping themselves up-to-date so they can shop around smartly, criticize people like you and optimize their choices. You need to receive the same level of education, if not more, in order to correspond to their level of expertise and demand. If at the gateways of your data center, you don’t pitch the right message, your clients will automatically doubt your competence across your NOC personnel, Ops management, facility guys and so forth. So make sure your people who know what they are talking about.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Sell density not footprint – IT equipment is becoming denser by the minute. This means less space, more throughput. i.e. the space that used to power up 3kW in 42Us can now potentially power up upwards of 30kW. So it’s all about productivity and throughput, not meters/feet, number of racks and cabinets. So why focus on areas that your audience (IT professionals) don’t? What’s important to IT is optimum efficiency (the maxed-out utilization of resources). So whether you like it or not, this is no longer a real estate business. Sell what people want to buy, (throughput, capacity, reliability) not the actual footprint, which is shrinking faster than you can adjust your prices.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Data center is no longer a real estate business.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Sell cooling not power – If you were to choose from putting a kVA power figure vs a kW cooling per rack on your brochure, put cooling. People have realized, by experience, that the main art of building robust data center facilities is not power as much as it is cooling. Getting enough power to a rack is a matter of having the required capacity and dropping the power connection to that rack. But getting same amount of cooling to a rack is not that simple. Issues such as temperature, airflow, dust, humidity, static and more come to play. So really, guaranteeing the right quality of cooling as well as quantity of air to the racks is the bottleneck of data centers today and that’s where you want to differentiate your offerings.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Show your people – It’s pretty much obvious that you spent tens or hundreds of millions of dollars into your brand new data center node. But what’s more comforting to see than simply the automatic curtains of your NOC that overlook the the data hall with glass windows and wide screen TVs, and topnotch gear, is showing the drivers of your infrastructure: people who will actually be running them. The qualifications, date of last training/certification of these people, backgrounds, policies they follow, your data center manual, etc. all prove that you have a game plan and the people to execute it! You are only as good as the people who run your data center. It is like showing people a very nice surgery room but hiding the surgeon! Who will do the actual operation and be in charge of what I consider my life or my data, is really the key. Unfortunately most commercial data centers fail to introduce their operation staff, as a default practice during client tours. It’s simply not part of the sales process. Too many times, people have sales guys show them the gates of heaven, but once they sign that contract, let’s just say, things changed. In general, if you haven’t realized yet, clients feel more comfortable with your mature technical personnel than their sales counterparts. For one, technical people typically know what they’re talking about and speak more of the truth since they know the implications of what they promise. Subconsciously, clients trust technical guys more subconsciously. Another advantage of bringing your technical team to the forefront of the data center gates and end-user arena in the good times and not just when problem erupts, is to expose them to the outside world and allow them to see the effectiveness of their designs, plans, and executions in the growth and prosperity of the company they work for and the end-users that put their stakes in their hands.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>You are only as good as the people who run your data center.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Know your limits – You have built a 100,000 sqf data center node. Nice! What does it mean? You have 10MW there. Nice! Is it cooling? Is it power? Is it redundant cooling or power or just your total transformer capacity? How much of this can run under the active load while maintaining the reliability levels driven from the redundancies you are promising in your SLAs? Do you have the people, land, floor, money and safety measures required to deliver as client needs ramp up? What are your strengths and weakness? It’s good to know and acknowledge facts about your data center delivery capabilities before your clients point them out. Do your internal OLAs add up to the SLAs you are offering to your clients? What’s your existing strategy? Do you share that with the clients that trust you with the survival of their businesses? Being honest to yourself and transparent to your clients is fundamental.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Sell SLA, not SFI – The number of UPS, Generators and CRAH units at the SFI (Site Facility Infrastructure) level are really nothing but a promise unless your SLA warrants their viability to the client. Touring people around and showing N+1, 2N and 2(N+1) configurations to them is nice, but what’s nicer is guaranteeing the actual measurable output of these facilities through a solid and reliable SLA. The reason that a solid SLA is valued more than just your infrastructure is because you cannot take all these inputs and cater desirable outputs without a proper operational regime as well as the availability of necessary resources required for the SLA to deliver as promised. Therefore, the actual SLA that you can realistically deliver is more key to the ultimate health of your business than the N configurations of the boxes in your electrical and mechanical rooms.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>This list can go on. But properly digesting and getting started with the above can already be a leap forward towards a sustainable data center business strategy…</p>

                <p>In most economic reports, political agendas, even credit application forms, “data center” is not mentioned as an economy sector, community driver, or a recognized industry. Often data center is classified under Information Technology, Telecommunication, Facilities, Security, Real Estate and/or any other generic category that, by the common opinion, comes close. In reality, these alterations are misleading and inappropriate.</p>
                <p>Question is, “Where would the biggest drivers of our economy be without their data centers? Where would Amazon or Google be? Where would any Fortune 500 or Government entity be without its data center/s” If they even existed, they would probably be nowhere near where they are today. Data centers are empowering our day-to-day lives, beyond our comprehension. However, the most critical industry in the world today has no name or category belonging to it. Why is that? Do we have a voice beyond our small but impactful community? If yes, do we even know the essential characteristics of our own industry? How/will this lack of recognition be changed?</p>
                <p>It is inevitable that eventually the data center industry will be recognized just as any other industry. The world has no choice but to soon realize that we, the data center professionals, are a big reason they carry on with their day-to-day lives. However, every time there is a defect on the outer walls of our industry, we must look inward to see what is moistening and damaging our fortitude. If we look deeply enough, we will notice that we are facing an identity crisis within the data center industry. But what are some of the root causes of this crisis? What is rusting us from within, before we even mature? Here we pose some remedies and reminders, to us all:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Knowing our roots – In order to be proud of the industry we come from, we must first understand its history and background (roots). How did it all begin? What’s keeping us at work? What triggered the unofficial formation of our industry and what’s keeping us from becoming official? What were the achievements and shortfalls of our predecessors?</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>What triggered the unofficial formation of our industry and what’s keeping us from becoming official?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Going around – Visiting other data centers and seeing beyond our typical reach, will open our eyes to the broader data center community. Seeing other data centers, both within the vertical industries we serve and beyond will give see-through vision of our industry. The more data centers we visit, the more we connect with the nature of data centers, their stakeholders, their risks and their potentials.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Linking with peers – Going to exhibitions, training events, workshops, road shows, using social media and so forth is instrumental. Getting to know others who work in the data center industry in different capacities (engineers, technicians, operators, owners, and end-users from across industries) helps create the community that we must be a part of.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Going beyond borders – We are living in a global village where the only thing standing between us and the outside world, is our determination for discovery and exploration. There are vast possibilities beyond our physical borders, including but not limited to data centers of all types, experts with all kinds of talent and end-users with diverse needs with regards to availability, security, efficiency, innovation, etc.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>The only thing standing between us and the outside world, is our determination for discovery and exploration.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Knowing the purpose of data centers – What are data centers? What purpose are they supposed to fulfill? Unfortunately, many people in our community don’t know the correct answer to these fundamental questions. In retrospect, knowing the true essence of any industry is essential in adjusting our expectations to that industry. I will elaborate on this in a different post.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Acknowledging the data center impact – Once we have a firm grip on the meaning and purpose of data centers, we can realize their impact. What is the role, value and impact of data centers to the rest of the world? How are data centers important to other professions and industries? Knowing this relevance is key in acknowledging and amplifying our own identity.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Having relevant job titles – Knowing our role in the data center and having proper job titles and descriptions is fundamental. For example, according to IDCA, a DCNM (data center node manager) is responsible for managing day-to-day operations of a specific data center node while a DCCM (data center cloud manager) is in charge of managing application delivery over a cloud of data centers arranged in a specific manner (the topology). Therefore, using generic titles like “data center manager” will not help our community.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Building confidence – Not having the right level of confidence in day-to-day involvements prevents individuals from possessing a sense of confidence in their own field. This can emerge from a lack of adequate education and training. In general, that lack of confidence weakens our role in the community. Subsequently, a community made up of weak members is a reduced community with weak principles, agendas and drivers.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>A community made up of weak members is a reduced community with weak principles, agendas and drivers.</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Spelling it out – To speed up and help in creating our data center identity, we should become more fluent in speaking about our industry. For example, when we are asked, “What is your expertise?” we should not respond “IT”, or “I’m an Electrical Engineer”, “I’m an Architect”, etc. Rather our responses should be “Data Center”, “Data Center Electrical Engineer”, “Data Center Architect” and so forth. Same principle applies in filling out application forms.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>By building confidence, pride, acknowledgement, education and network, we can develop awareness towards the data center industry, which is becoming the foundation of practically all others. In short, if the data center stops working, healthcare, law enforcement, hotels, airlines, defense and nearly every other industry halt! Not to mention the likes of Google, Facebook, Amazon and the respective services they offer would effectively not exist. Therefore, we should reach out and get to know others in the data center community and our potential colleagues from other industries. While doing that, we should not ignore the fact that we are all professionals in the same horizontal industry serving different verticals!</p>
                <p>It should all start with us (the professionals in the data center industry) knowing the true meaning of data centers, including where they fit in the industry breakdown and what it means to the people around us.</p>
                <p>In terms of definition, the data center is the infrastructure that supports the application ecosystem (AE). Again, I’ll elaborate more on this later. For now, note that if you define your work as anything less, you are shrinking your importance and relevance to the rest of the world. A data center is not a place filled with UPSs, generators and a bunch of electrical equipment; nor is it a place filled with pipes, CRAHs, chillers, etc.; or warehouse of core routers, switches, SAN, blades, etc. It is the infrastructure (both physical and virtual) that encompasses all of the above and more, for the sole purpose of delivering the “application”.   When you get that down, you know that you come to work every day so that the doctor, the policeman, the accountant, the clerk, the customer support agent, etc. do what they are supposed to be doing using the applications that facilitate their work. Therefore, you would know what you and your field means to the people around you.</p>
                <p>In terms of knowing where data centers fit in the industry breakdown, it might be useful to note that data center is not an industry vertical. Data center is an industry horizontal.</p>
                <p>According to Wikipedia:</p>
                <h4>“A horizontal market is a market in which a product or service meets a specific need of a wide range of buyers across different sectors of an economy.”</h4>
                <p>Data center, like other horizontals such as accounting and legal services, provides the platform for vertical industries to sustain growth and maintain business.</p>
                <p>Not surprisingly, data center is becoming more and more the foundational service delivery agent, not just for verticals, but also for the horizontal industries that can no longer live without it.</p>
                <p>All said, to remedy our identity crisis, we must acknowledge the very ground that we stand on. To make a comparison to our national identity, we can’t possibly know our supposed identity as citizens of any country if we don’t know, for example, how our nation was established, on the basis of which values, how it evolved to this point and what being citizens of our nation means to us and to the rest of the world. We cannot possibly claim to be working in an industry in which its history, attributes, purpose and true merits aren’t clear to us.</p>
                <h4>We cannot possibly claim to be working in an industry in which its history, attributes, purpose and true merits aren’t clear to us.</h4>
                <p>The data center industry is at its infancy, well below the maturity line. It is undergoing a steep learning curve, possessing and buffering explosive energy with a wider tolerance for trial & error and risk acceptance than is welcomed in the mature markets that require its service delivery. Knowing where we come from and where we’re headed could resolve our identity crisis and make the maturity cycle shorter and less costly.</p>

                <p>Often I am asked to start a data center blog and provide the data center community my points of view to the whole data center ordeal. Obviously data center is a focal expertise of mine. But life is not all about one’s field of work. Our educational system, political arena, economic challenges, diverse cultures and norms within and around us, depict the very atmosphere we live in. So there is a lot to be said about the above and more.   But let’s start with data centers and see where it takes us…</p>
